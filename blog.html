            <h2>Differences between filter, forEach and find method</h2>
            <p>

                <strong> filter Method:
                </strong>
                The filter method is used to create a new array containing all elements that pass a provided function's
                test.

                It iterates over each element in the array and includes elements in the new array if the provided
                function returns true.

            </p>

            <p><strong>forEach Method:</strong>

                Purpose: Executes a provided function once for each array element.

                Return Value: There is no explicit return value (returns undefined).

                Use Case: Used for performing an action or side effect for each element in the array.</p>


            <p>
                <strong> find Method:</strong>

                The find method is used to return the first element in the array that satisfies the provided testing
                function.

                It stops searching once an element is found, and it returns undefined if no element satisfies the
                condition.

            <h2>Differences between
                LocalStorage, SessionStorage, and Cookies</h2>


            <p>
                <strong>LocalStorage:</strong><br><br>

                <strong>Scope:</strong> Works across different browser sessions and tabs.
                Lifespan: Persists even when the browser is closed until manually cleared.
                Use Case: Good for storing data you want to keep for a long time, like user preferences.
                SessionStorage:
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong> Scope:</strong> Limited to a single browser session and specific to a tab.
                Lifespan: Clears when the tab is closed or the browser session ends.
                Use Case: Useful for storing temporary data needed for a short time.
                Cookies:
            </p>


            <p>

                <strong> Scope:</strong> Works across different browser sessions and tabs, sent with every request to
                the server.
                Lifespan: Can have an expiration date, persists even after the browser is closed if not expired.
                Use Case: Commonly used for authentication tokens and small pieces of data exchanged between the client
                and server.

            <h2>What is Event Loop ?</h2>



            <p>The event loop is like a traffic cop in JavaScript that manages the execution of code. It ensures tasks
                are processed one by one, allowing non-blocking operations. This helps maintain smooth performance and
                responsiveness in web applications.</p>

            <h2>Some functions and their works</h2>
            <p><strong>function 1:</strong><br><br>
                const quizTimer = (dismiss) => {<br>
                if (dismiss) {<br>
                clearInterval(timer);<br>

                return;<br>
                } <br>
                <br>

                <strong>note:</strong>This function, quizTimer, takes a parameter dismiss. If dismiss is true, it clears
                the interval previously set by setInterval(timer). In simple terms, it stops a recurring timer or
                countdown used in a quiz when the condition is met, likely when the quiz is dismissed or completed.
            </p>
